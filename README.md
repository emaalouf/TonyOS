This platform is still in heavy development.
The name TonyOS is dedicated to my brother, Tony, one of the best siblings a man can get. I dedicate this project to his name because of the motivation he always gives, I also want to dedicate this success to them. I want to thank the Maalouf family also for their evergoing support!


Not to forget these amazing induviduals for always pushing me for more:
-Michel Maalouf
-Christophe El Khoury
-Mike Nasr
-Nicolas El Khoury
-Joseph Abboud
-Hussein Doui

README Docs Coming Soon, activation script coming soon, builds coming soon, for now all I've got is a source code that I run through a ton of commands that I will work on doing with just one script!

Short Summary: 
When I was 14, I was introduced into the world of servers, it blew my mind, ever since, I've been researching and looking into servers and how they function! these amazing machines need something to operate them, how do they function with all these requests within a matter of seconds, all this blew my mind away. I wanted to make mine, but how?

Long story short, I've been researching and started building this project a few years ago, I failed miserably the first few times until I finally got it! Once I did, I started building the TonyOS, I've learned C and C++, and is currently working on this project using this amazing technology!

The gits might be low but it's been a hectic work under the hood, so I didn't want to expose all the mess to get here! I will just expose one small secret, it's a simplified Arch Linux system!

Stay Tuned!
